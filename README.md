MAZE SOLVER
A Maze Solver Game involves navigating through a maze, where the goal is to find the
most efficient route from the starting point to the destination. The maze is typically
made up of pathways and obstacles, and the objective is to avoid the obstacles while
finding the quickest path to the goal.
• Maze Layout: The maze is usually represented as a grid, where each cell is either
a pathway (walkable area) or a wall (obstacle).
There is a starting point where the player begins and a goal point where they
need to reach.
• MOVEMENT: The player can move in different directions, such as up, down, left,
or right, aiming to find the best possible route while avoiding walls.
• MAZE REPRESENTATION: In a maze represented as a grid, the values 0 and 1
commonly used to differentiate between pathways and walls:
0 (Pathway): This value represents a walkable area in the maze. The player can
move through these cells, and these are part of the possible routes to reach the
goal.
1 (Wall): This value represents an obstacle or impassable area. The player cannot
move through these cells, and they block progress along the path.
• Visualizing the Path: Once the best route is found, the maze solver typically
highlights the path from the start to the goal. This is often shown with colors or
lines to differentiate it from the walls.
